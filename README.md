# About

A simple question and answer platform application that was proposed in a training and improved in this version, with many new features implemented.

We used several very interesting resources that are used in various applications by many companies.

Features such as:
- Validations
- Elegant notices via SweetAlert
- Layout improvements
- Option to filter by question category

among others
